# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Overview

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending service company that I assessed credit risk for. The number of good loans outnumber the number of risky loans, so I applied different techniques to train and evaluate the unbalanced classes. I used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. I also evaluated the performance of these models and made a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

Summary

After comparing all the models used, none of them performed to the accuracy or precision needed to predict high risk loans. Having a dataset that is unbalanced with a small number of high risk loans is having an effect of the model performance, even when offsetting the distribution. I would recommend balancing the data by adding more high risk loan data to increase accuracy.
